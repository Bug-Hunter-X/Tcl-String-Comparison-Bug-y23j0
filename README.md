This repository contains a simple Tcl procedure that demonstrates an unexpected behavior when comparing strings using the == operator. The procedure `badproc` compares two arguments. If the arguments are numerically equal but are different types (e.g. one is a string, the other a number), it will incorrectly return 0.  The solution demonstrates how to properly compare numerical values, avoiding potential issues with string-based comparisons.
